# 🚀 CPU Scheduling Simulator

A web-based **CPU Scheduling Simulator** built using **HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project visually demonstrates how different CPU scheduling algorithms work using an interactive Gantt Chart and automatic performance calculations.

## 🌟 Key Features

- ✅ Implements Multiple CPU Scheduling Algorithms:
  - FCFS (First Come First Serve)
  - SJF (Shortest Job First – Non-Preemptive)
  - Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive)
  - Round Robin

- ✅ Dynamic Process Input (1–10 Processes)

- ✅ Automatic Calculation of:
  - Completion Time (CT)
  - Waiting Time (WT)
  - Turnaround Time (TAT)
  - Average Waiting Time
  - Average Turnaround Time
  - Throughput

- ✅ Interactive Gantt Chart Visualization

- ✅ Clean and Responsive User Interface

- ✅ Custom Error Handling System
